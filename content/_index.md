The Northeast Geobiology Symposium has brought scientists throughout the northeastern US and Canada through their common interests in geobiology for over a decade. The overarching goal for this meeting is to provide an inclusive environment for researchers at various stages of their development to learn from their peers and develop collaborative relationships for future work. A common thread of this conference is that it is free to attend and organized and run by students and postdocs. Therefore, a group of postdocs and graduate students from the Department of Earth Sciences are underway planning next yearâ€™s symposium.

We gratefully acknowledge the generous support from the [Agouron Institute](https://agi.org/), ThermoFisher Scientific, and Dartmouth College. 

Best regards from your organizing committee,
