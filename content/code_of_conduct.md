# Code of Conduct

The Northeast Geobiology Meeting strives to be a place where all members of our community can feel safe and included. Behavior that prevents this from happening is unacceptable.

## All meeting participants are to:

- Be treated with respect and consideration.
- Be considerate, collegial, and collaborative.
- Communicate openly, with civil attitudes, critiquing ideas rather than individuals.
- Avoid personal attacks
- Alert meeting organizers if you notice someone in distress, or perceive a potentially dangerous situation, or witness a dangerous situation.

## Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to,:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination.
- Physical or verbal abuse
- Audio and video recording, or taking images of an individual’s oral presentation *without* the presenters’ permission, is expressly forbidden. Images of posters taken without permission are not allowed. Images of posters may be taken with the explicit consent of the presenter, and images may be acquired only in the presence of the presenter.

## Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to,:

- Verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, national origin.
- Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces or in presentations.
- Intentional, uninvited physical contact of any form.
- Threats (implied or real) of, physical, professional or financial harm.

## Consequences of unacceptable behavior:

- Anyone requested to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to immediately cease and desist.
- Meeting organizers may institute actions including immediate removal from the meeting.

## Reporting unacceptable behavior:

If you are the subject of unacceptable behavior or have witnessed any such behavior, please immediately notify a meeting organizer (Tim Gibson, Akshay Mehra, Tianran Zhang, Sarah Slotznick, or Justin Strauss) in-person, by e-mail, or by phone.

Anyone experiencing or witnessing behavior that constitutes an immediate or serious threat to public safety, or a criminal act is expected to contact 911.  Those witnessing a potential criminal act should also take actions necessary to maintain their own personal safety.
