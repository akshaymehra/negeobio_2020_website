            In response to the continuing spread of COVID-19, we are postponing the Northeast Geobiology Symposium until <b>April 2021</b>. We apologize for any inconvenience this delay may impose, but the planning committee has decided it would be irresponsible to continue with the event as planned in the face of heath and safety recommendations to avoid nonessential large gatherings. We believe rescheduling for April 2021 is the best option to prevent further delay and also to ensure the quality and turnout of this meeting. We will be in touch once we finalize dates.
