            In response to the continuing spread of COVID-19, we are postponing the Northeast Geobiology Symposium until <b>April 2021</b>. We apologize for any inconvenience this delay may impose, but the planning committee has decided it would be irresponsible to continue with the event as planned in the face of heath and safety recommendations to avoid nonessential large gatherings. We believe rescheduling for April 2021 is the best option to prevent further delay and also to ensure the quality and turnout of this meeting. We will be in touch once we finalize dates.

<h1 id="welcome-to-the-2020-northeast-geobiology-symposium-website">Welcome to the 2020 Northeast Geobiology Symposium Website!</h1>

<h2 id="this-year-s-event-will-be-hosted-by-the-department-of-earth-science-at-dartmouth-college-in-hanover-nh-on-april-24-25">This year’s event will be hosted by the Department of Earth Science at <strong>Dartmouth College</strong> in <strong>Hanover, NH</strong> on <strong>April 24-25</strong>.</h2>

<p>The Northeast Geobiology Symposium has brought scientists throughout the northeastern US and Canada through their common interests in geobiology for over a decade. The overarching goal for this meeting is to provide an inclusive environment for researchers at various stages of their development to learn from their peers and develop collaborative relationships for future work. A common thread of this conference is that it is free to attend and organized and run by students and postdocs. Therefore, a group of postdocs and graduate students from the Department of Earth Sciences are underway planning next year’s symposium.</p>

<p>We gratefully acknowledge the generous support from the <a href="https://agi.org/">Agouron Institute</a> and Dartmouth College.</p>

<p>Best regards from your organizing committee,</p>
