      <description>Code of Conduct The Northeast Geobiology Meeting strives to be a place where all members of our community can feel safe and included. Behavior that prevents this from happening is unacceptable.
All meeting participants are to:  Be treated with respect and consideration. Be considerate, collegial, and collaborative. Communicate openly, with civil attitudes, critiquing ideas rather than individuals. Avoid personal attacks Alert meeting organizers if you notice someone in distress, or perceive a potentially dangerous situation, or witness a dangerous situation.</description>
